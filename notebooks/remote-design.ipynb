    "## What is a VPN?\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Overview\n",
    "A VPN (Virtual Private Network) creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and a server. Think of it as a private tunnel through the internet that:\n",
    "- Encrypts all your internet traffic\n",
    "- Hides your real IP address\n",
    "- Protects your data on public WiFi\n",
    "- Allows access to resources as if you were on the same network as the server\n",
    "\n",
    "### WireGuard Specifically\n",
    "WireGuard is a modern VPN protocol that's:\n",
    "- **Fast**: Uses state-of-the-art cryptography\n",
    "- **Simple**: Minimal code base (about 4,000 lines vs 100,000+ for alternatives)\n",
    "- **Secure**: Modern cryptographic principles\n",
    "- **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android\n",
    "\n",
    "## Server Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- A Linux server (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)\n",
    "- Root or sudo access\n",
    "- Public IP address\n",
    "- Port 51820 open in firewall\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Update system and install WireGuard:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo apt update`  \n",
    "`sudo apt install wireguard`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate Server Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd /etc/wireguard`  \n",
    "`umask 077`  \n",
    "`wg genkey | sudo tee private.key`  \n",
    "`sudo cat private.key | wg pubkey | sudo tee public.key`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create Server Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Create `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Interface]\n",
    "Address = 10.0.0.1/24\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Replace `eth0` with your server's network interface if different. Check with `ip a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enable IP Forwarding\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Make it permanent:\n",
    "\n",
    "`echo \"net.ipv4.ip_forward=1\" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf`\n",

    "### Import on Client Device\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mobile (iOS/Android)**:\n",
    "1. Install WireGuard app\n",
    "2. Scan QR code or import file\n",

    "## Troubleshooting (General)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Check server status:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo systemctl status wg-quick@wg0`  \n",
    "`sudo wg show`\n",
    "\n",
    "Check logs:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo journalctl -u wg-quick@wg0 -n 50`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Firewall Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure port 51820 is open:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo ufw allow 51820/udp`\n",
    "\n",
    "### IP Forwarding Not Working\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify it's enabled:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward`\n",
    "\n",
    "Should return 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client Can't Connect\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verify server is running\n",
    "2. Check firewall rules\n",
    "3. Verify client config has correct server IP and port\n",
    "4. Check if client's public key is in server config\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keep private keys private**: Never share or transmit private keys insecurely\n",
    "2. **Use strong keys**: WireGuard generates cryptographically strong keys automatically\n",
    "3. **Limit AllowedIPs**: Only route necessary traffic through VPN\n",
    "4. **Regular updates**: Keep WireGuard and system packages updated\n",
    "5. **Monitor logs**: Regularly check for unusual activity\n",
    "6. **Revoke access promptly**: Remove peers immediately when access should end\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Split Tunneling\n",
    "\n",
    "To only route specific traffic through VPN, change `AllowedIPs` in client config:\n",
    "\n",
    "`AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/24`  (only VPN subnet)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of:\n",
    "\n",
    "`AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0`  (all traffic)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Servers\n",
    "\n",
    "Clients can have multiple WireGuard configurations for different servers. Each needs unique keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IPv6 Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Add IPv6 addresses to both server and client configs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Server: `Address = 10.0.0.1/24, fd00::1/64`  \n",
    "Client: `Address = 10.0.0.2/32, fd00::2/128`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding New Clients\n",
    "\n",
    "See \"Client Setup\" or \"Automated Management\" sections above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Revoking Client Access\n",
    "\n",
    "**Manual method**: Remove the `[Peer]` section from `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` and restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automated method**: Use `rto.remove_peer()` as described in the Automated Management section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backup Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularly backup:\n",
    "- `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`\n",
    "- `/etc/wireguard/private.key`\n",
    "- `peers.csv` (if using automated management)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Check active connections:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo wg show`\n",
    "\n",
    "View bandwidth usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo wg show wg0 transfer`\n",
