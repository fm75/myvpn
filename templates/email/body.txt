Hi!

I've set up VPN access for you. Here's how to get connected:

1. Download the attached file (it ends in .conf)
2. Open the WireGuard app on your device
3. Tap the "+" button
4. Choose "Create from file" or "Import from file"
5. Select the file you just downloaded
6. Tap "Save" or "Activate"

That's it! Once activated, you can turn the VPN on and off with a simple switch.

If you have any trouble, just reply to this email.
